\description{
This function is implemented to perform individual deconvolution methods.  The current implementation of
EnDecon integrates twelve state-of-the-art methods:  CARD, cell2location, DeconRNASeq, DWLS, MuSiC (MuSiC weighted and MuSiC all gene), RCTD, SCDC, SpatialDWLS,
SPOTlight,Stereoscope, and SVR. These packages will be automatically installed along
with EnDecon. \cr
